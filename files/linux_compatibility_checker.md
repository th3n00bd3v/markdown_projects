## ⚠️ **Potential Issues & Fixes**

### 🔌 1. **Wi-Fi / Bluetooth Adapter**

* Some laptops models ship with **Realtek or Broadcom** chipsets, which need proprietary drivers.

**Fix**:

* During or after installation, go to:

  ```
  Software & Updates → Additional Drivers
  ```

  and enable the proprietary Wi-Fi driver (Realtek or Broadcom).

If that doesn’t appear:

```bash
sudo apt install rtl8821ce-dkms  # Or similar, based on your Wi-Fi chipset
```

---

### 🔋 2. **Battery Life & Power Management**

* Ubuntu won’t apply battery optimizations by default. You may notice:

  * Higher CPU usage
  * No auto power tuning

**Fix**:
Install power tools:

```bash
sudo apt install tlp powertop
sudo tlp start
```

---

### 🎧 3. **Audio Switching (Headphones)**

* On some laptops, audio doesn’t switch automatically between speakers and headphones.

**Fix**:
Install `pavucontrol` (PulseAudio Volume Control):

```bash
sudo apt install pavucontrol
```

Use it to manually select input/output sources.

---

### 🌐 4. **Function Keys / Brightness Control**

* Sometimes the brightness keys or volume keys don’t work out of the box.

**Fix**:

* Add kernel parameters like `acpi_backlight=vendor` or use `brightnessctl`.
* Most cases work fine with current kernels.

---

### 🧠 5. **Fingerprint Sensor**

* If your model has a fingerprint reader, Linux may not support it out-of-the-box.

**Fix**:

* Use `fprintd` (partial support) or skip using it.

### 📥 Optional Tools for Compatibility Checking

```bash
sudo apt install hardinfo inxi
inxi -F
```

This will give you a full hardware status summary to check for any missing drivers.
